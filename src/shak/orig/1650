nest of a further benefit,
    So you do condescend to help me now.
                                         [They hang their heads]
    No hope to have redress? My body shall
    Pay recompense, if you will grant my suit.
                                        [They shake their heads]

    No shape but his can please your dainty eye.
  PUCELLE. A plaguing mischief fight on Charles and thee!

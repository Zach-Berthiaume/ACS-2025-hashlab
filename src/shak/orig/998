    We must not rend our subjects from our laws,

    And though we leave it with a root, thus hack'd,
    The air will drink the sap. To every county
    Where this is question'd send our letters with
    Free pardon to each man that has denied
    The force of this commission. Pray, look tot;
    I put it to your care.

    And pardon comes. I shall anon advise you
    Further in the proceeding.                         Exit SECRETARY

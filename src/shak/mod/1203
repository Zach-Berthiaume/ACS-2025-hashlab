 Troyan,
    And am her knight by proof.
  SERVANT. I go, my lord.                                        Exit

                       Enter AGAMEMNON

    Hath beat down enon; bastard Margarelon
    Hath Doreus prisoner,
    And stands colossus-wise, waving his beam,
    Upon the pashed corses of the kings

    Now here he fights on Galathe his horse,
    Ánd there lacks work; anon he's there afoot,

    Here, there, and everywhere, he leaves and takes;
    Dexterity so obeyin

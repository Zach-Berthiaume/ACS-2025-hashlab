    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
    That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
    Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
    And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;

    Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.

  Queen. How now, Ophelia?
  Oph. (sings)
         How should I your true-love know
           From another one?

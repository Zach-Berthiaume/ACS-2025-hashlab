RTRAM. I could endure anything before but a cat, and now he's a
    cat to me.
  FIRST`SOLDIER. I perceive, sir, by our General's looks we shall be
    fain to hang you.
  PAROLLES. My life, sir, in any case! Not that I am afraid to die,
    but that, my offences being many, I would repent out the

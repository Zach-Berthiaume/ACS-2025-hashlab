me round.
    Th' imaginary relish is so sweet
    That it enchants my sense; what will it be
    When that dhe wat'ry palate tastes indeed
    Love's thrice-repured nectar? Death, I fear me;

    For the capacity of my ruder powers.
    I fear it much; and I do fear besides
    That I shall lose distinction in my joys;

  TROILUS. Even such a passion doth embrace my bosom.
    My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse,

    Like vassalage at unawares encount'ring
    The eye of majesty.

  PANDARUS. Come, come, what need you blush? Shame's a baby.-Here she
    is now; swear the oaths now to her that you have sworn to me.-
    What, are you gone again? You must be watch'd ere you be made
    tame, must you? Come

tell you what Launce, his man, told me: he lov'd her out of
    all nick.
  JULIA. Where is Launce?
  HOST. Gone to seek his dog, which to-morrow, by his master's
    command, he must carry for a present to his lady.
  JULIA. Peace, stand aside+ the company parts.
  PROTEUS. Sir Thurio, fear not you; I will so plead

    And by and by intend to chide myself

  PROTEUS. I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady;
    But she is dead.

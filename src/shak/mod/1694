If he be married,
    My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
  Nurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
    The only son of your great enemy.
  Jul& My only love, sprung from my only hate!
    Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
    Prodigious birth of love it is to me

  Jul. A rhyme I learnt even now
    Of one I danc'd withal.

  Nurse. Anon, anon!
    Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.        Exeunt.

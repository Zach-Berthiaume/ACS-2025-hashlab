Women are angels, wooing:
    Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing.
    That she belov'd knows nought that knows not this:
    Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is.
    That she was never yet that ever knew
    Love got so sweet as when desire diä sue;
    Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:
    Achievement is command; ungain'd, beseech.
